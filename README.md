Objective
===
Build a mobile first checkout form based on the faults of a real world website. Add front end validation with accurate messages.

- Use vanilla JS components as appropriate to modularize the app
- Use JavaScript, DOM Events and the Form Validity API to provide a great user experience.


Steps Taken
===

Use component architecture, blur event listeners, and the validation API to create a fast-responding feedback experience. Recreate the login page with password and username guidance. Have form submit buttons inactive unless the form is valid. Create a shipping address, billing address, shipping method, payment, and review page. If the billing address is same as shipping, have user skip billing page. This lab took me ~10 hours.

Changes / Reflection
===

This was my first time working with the validation API, as well as creating a front-end router. I was able to create multiple types of form validation that responded quickly to input. I did not have enough time to place a sample product review page, or running total summary. The app is meant to be viewed only in mobile.
